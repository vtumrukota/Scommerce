# SCommerce

I began the application by first creating a Github repo and cloning that down onto my local laptop. Next I decided to use yeoman to quickly create a web application using gulp to help automate development. I decided to use Bootstrap to help make the site responsive on different screen sizes as well and to take advantage of its grid system.

I laid out all the html into different containers and separated each portion of the page into a different element. I took a top down approach and left placeholders for links and would stlye the CSS as I would move down the page.

As I was doing alot of the styling I took advantage of the Digital Color Meter Application to set the precise RGB color for each element. I also managed to use a Font-Matcher to find the Header font and implemented that as well. I used a couple lines of jquery and the bootstrap carousel to create a quick scrolling carousel with some base images. 

I tried to use best practices throughout the project and wrote my CSS in a top down approach so that it flows easily with the page. 

To run the app, simply clone down the repo, run <code>npm install & bower install</code> and then run <code>gulp serve</code> to run on your local machine. I had a really good time building out the application and would be happy to answer any additional questions you had about the site/my process during building!
